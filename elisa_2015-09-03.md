# Article ideas

1. Sugar-cane factory workers 
* impact of malaria control on absenteeism
* pairs well with the school stuff  
* Sergio and some young academic working on school absenteeism  
* Some data messiness issues  

2. Discrete choice
* Trying to understand preferences of community towards malaria control tools
* Lots of literature trying to understand preferences
* Two approaches:
  * What do people actually do to treat/prevent?
  * Instead of observing what they _do_, see what they _think_ (and what would maximize their utility function)
    * discrete choice model is a way of doing that.
    * what is the value of the community on various malaria strategies?
    * very interesting at the moment due to malaria vaccine's intro
    * this study can also be a way to find out what people think, etc. in a situation in which they know very well what malaria is
    * WE have to collect the data
    * But easier than the sugar cane factory stuff
    * The research center in Mozambique will make community integration easy
