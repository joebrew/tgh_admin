## Instructions

Generate 5 learning questions regarding inter- and trans- disciplinary research that will guide your personal learning agenda over the course. Bring these 5 questions to the first class

## Questions

1. How can one best "zoom in" when it comes to qualitative research, using tools and approaches from multiple disciplines while not "losing the forest for the trees"?  

2. What is the appropriate balance between scientist and activist/politicist in regards to public health action?  (inspired by Pisani)

3. How can we address the need for unbiasedness and reproducibility when mode 2 learning is so "interactive and iterative"?  (inspired by Reeger and Bunders)

4. What do Reeger and Bunders even mean by "implicit" scientific knowledge? (page 30)

5. What is the balance between trans-, inter-, and pluri-disciplinarity.  Does my project lend itself to one or the other?
